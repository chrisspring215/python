After the release of ”Visions”, they quickly followed with the tropical-tinged ”Don‘t Say No” (featuring Dresses), ”Senses” (featuring Lostboycrow), and ”Adventure” (featuring Evan Wartner). As they gained exposure on social media and spins on streaming services (over 55 million on Spotify, plus 15 million on YouTube), they joined the Chainsmokers on tour. Successive singles continued to drop into 2016, when they unveiled ”Sex” (featuring Kris Kross Amsterdam), which borrowed the sentiment and chorus from the Salt-N- Pepa classic ”Let‘s Talk About Sex.”",
